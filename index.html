				<p>
					I am a San Diego based front end developer. I'm familiar with HTML/CSS and jQuery. I also know a bit about PHP, mySQL, Angular 1 and 4. I'm currently enrolled in UCSD extension bootcamp to learn about Express, Node.js and MongoDB. Seriously looking forward to it. Besides Express, Node and Mongo I also would love to learn about unit testing as well as learn some new tools for various things. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Having worked in the social marketing field for the past 10 years I learnt the importance of web assessibility. I make sure my products are 508 compliance and screen-reader assessible. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Aside from programming I also love hiking, anime and video games. I love to build things so video games that allow building things are my favorites. Games such as FallOut 4, Minecraft and Fortnite are best. I wonder how much time I wasted on those games haha.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am also a HUGE cat lover. I am actively involved in volunteering for some of our local feral cat groups. I have been helping <a href="http://www.feralcat.com/" target="_blank">FCC</a> with their Trap/Neuter/Release program to help reduce the number of feral cats in communities as well as to improve their quality of lives out there. I also manage a small feral cat colony of three cats.
